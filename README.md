# Tic Tac Toe

### Abstract:
This game of Tic Tac Toe was my final project in week 6 of learning JavaScript at Turing School of Software and Design. The highlights of this project were to maintain professional git flow, break up a large task into manageable chunks, create and follow a project planner, and finally work through the logic of a simple game to create a functioning web application for two-player Tic Tac Toe without outside assistance.

### Installation Instructions:
Open this deploy link to see the game in action https://asherspurr.github.io/tic-tac-toe/

### Context:
This project took me approximately 3 days to finish, capping at around 15 hours, including the refactoring process. 

### Contributors:
Only I was working on this project. https://github.com/AsherSpurr

### Learning Goals:
#### Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
- DRY JavaScript
- event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### Wins + Challenges:
#### Wins:
  - Coming across a bug and being able to backtrack and follow my logic to find the origin.
  - Breaking down large objectives into manageable sections
  - Creating a detailed project planner and following it throughout the project
  - Increased git flow

#### Challenges:
  - Implementing local storage into the program without bugs.
