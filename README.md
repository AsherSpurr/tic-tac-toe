# Tic Tac Toe

### Abstract:
[//]: <>This game of Tic Tac Toe was my final project of Mod 1. The highlights of this project were to maintain professional git flow, break up a large task into manageable chunks, create and follow a project planner, and finally work through the logic of a simple game to create a functioning web application for two-player Tic Tac Toe without outside assistance.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> - Clone the repository to your local machine
        - run open index.html in your terminal
        - To see my 2nd version git fetch the branch css-coloring
        - checkout into this branch
        - run open index.html in your terminal
        - * A note about css-cloring branch. Please google trans egg before opening to understand the context

### Context:
[//]: <> This project took me approximately 3 days to finish, capping at around 15 hours, including the refactoring process. 

### Contributors:
[//]: <> Only I was working on this project. https://github.com/AsherSpurr

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
DRY JavaScript
event delegation to handle similar event listeners
Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <>A win was coming across a bug and backtracking to follow my logic and find the origin. One difficulty I faced was the extension using local storage, I decided I wanted a button to clear local storage if the user wanted a new game with new players. Adding this button pointed towards a possible flaw in my logic of how I was using the local storage. The extension was working before I cleared it, it now produces NaN values. Please check out the local-storage branch to take a look.
