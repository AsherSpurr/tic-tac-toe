# Tic Tac Toe

### Abstract:
This game of Tic Tac Toe was my final project in week 6 of learning JavaScript. The highlights of this project were to maintain professional git flow, break up a large task into manageable chunks, create and follow a project planner, and finally work through the logic of a simple game to create a functioning web application for two-player Tic Tac Toe without outside assistance.

### Installation Instructions:
Open this deploy link to see the game in action https://asherspurr.github.io/tic-tac-toe/

### Context:
This project took me approximately 3 days to finish, capping at around 15 hours, including the refactoring process. 

### Contributors:
Only I was working on this project. https://github.com/AsherSpurr

### Learning Goals:
#### Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
- DRY JavaScript
- event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### Wins + Challenges:
- A win was coming across a bug and backtracking to follow my logic and find the origin. 
- One difficulty I faced was the extension using local storage, I decided I wanted a button to clear local storage if the user wanted a new game with new players. Adding this button pointed towards a possible flaw in my logic of how I was using the local storage. The extension was working before I cleared it, it now produces NaN values. Please check out the local-storage branch to take a look.
